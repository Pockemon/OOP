Function take much time,because compiler have to jump when function is called from main and have to return when function execution is complete.

but when funciton code is small we can use inline function so that it will take less time.

inline function requests to compiler,compiler may or may not accept request.

Compiler may not perform inlining in such circumstances like:
1) If a function contains a loop. (for, while, do-while)
2) If a function contains static variables.
3) If a function is recursive.
4) If a function return type is other than void, and the return statement doesnâ€™t exist in function body.
5) If a function contains switch or goto statement.
